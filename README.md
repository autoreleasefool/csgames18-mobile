## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed before beginning:

- Latest version of Xcode (9.2)
- Recent version of the iOS SDK (at least 11.0)

You can download these from the [Apple Developer website](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/).

> **NOTE:** You need a Mac computer running macOS 10.12.6 or later. If you don't have one, go to our [Android app](https://github.com/mirego/csgames18-competition/tree/master/android), which can be run on Windows, Linux and older versions of macOS.

## Getting started

First, make sure you have cloned the project from Github:

```
git clone http://github.com/mirego/csgames18-competition.git
```

This project uses [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) as a dependency manager. If you don't have it already, install it with the following command:

```
sudo gem install cocoapods
```

Then fetch dependencies and build the workspace:

```
pod install
```

When completed, the project should be ready to open:

```
open MapPing.xcworkspace
```

If the request to AWS is failing, replace it with the static `mapping.json` file.
