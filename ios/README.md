# CS Games 2018 - Mobile Competition - iOS App

This project serves as a starting base for the CS Games 2018 Mobile Competition.

You may edit it as much as you like – as long as you make something awesome!

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed before beginning:

- Latest version of Xcode (9.2)
- Recent version of the iOS SDK (at least 11.0)

You can download these from the [Apple Developer website](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/).

> **NOTE:** You need a Mac computer running macOS 10.12.6 or later. If you don't have one, go to our [Android app](https://github.com/mirego/csgames18-competition/tree/master/android), which can be run on Windows, Linux and older versions of macOS.

## Getting started

First, make sure you have cloned the project from Github:

```
git clone http://github.com/mirego/csgames18-competition.git
```

Navigate into this directory:

```
cd csgames18-competition/ios
```

This project uses [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) as a dependency manager. If you don't have it already, install it with the following command:

```
sudo gem install cocoapods
```

Then fetch dependencies and build the workspace:

```
pod install
```

When completed, the project should be ready to open:

```
open MapPing.xcworkspace
```

## Building the project

In Xcode, run the project by simply pressing the "Play" button on the top left, or by hitting `⌘R`.

Once the app opens up in the iOS Simulator, you are ready to start coding.
